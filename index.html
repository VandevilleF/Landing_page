            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="about-story">
                <p>It all started with a simple observation: my girlfriend had trouble remembering the books she owned. She often found herself taking photos of her bookshelf or using post-it notes to write down the titles of the books she had. These solutions were impractical and often ineffective. That's how the idea for MyLib was born.</p>
                <p>MyLib is an application designed to help you easily manage your personal library. With MyLib, you can add or remove books from your collection in a snap, and quickly display detailed information about the books you own. Say goodbye to forgetfulness and unnecessary duplicates—your library is always at your fingertips.</p>
            <br>
                <p>Additionally, we are proud to mention that MyLib is a portfolio project for <font color="#e1003c">Holberton School</font>. You can learn more about Holberton School <a href="https://www.holbertonschool.com/">here.</a>.</p>
